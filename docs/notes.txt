What to do here:

Goal: Given a string, give file coordinates for occurrences of that string in a set of files.

Start with CSVs. File coordinate system: (row offset, column offset, cell offset).

Note: Can imagine other file coordinate systems for other file types. For example, you
can imagine there being hierarchical coordinates for hierarchical file types like XML or HTML.
Like XPATH expressions are a form of file coordinates, maybe even (XPATH expression, element offset).

One file coordinate system that all file types share is the 1-D byte offset coordinate system.

Start with a Python script that does this, then see if you can modify it for querying in PostgreSQL.
For PostgreSQL, want files to be loaded as text dumps in a table, or maybe even chunks of files.
Have helper tables that hold indexing information for scanning files/translating between coordinate systems?

Seems like that would make some sense for performance, but maybe just start with scanning files straight-up
at first; no chunks, either.
